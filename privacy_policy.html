        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: 31-Dec-2024</p>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>WhatsApp Checker</strong>. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our app.</p>

        <h2>1. Data We Access</h2>
        <p>The app uses the AccessibilityService API to perform its primary function of checking if a phone number is registered on WhatsApp. Through this API, the app accesses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Screen Content:</strong> To read and interpret relevant WhatsApp interface information.</li>
            <li><strong>UI Elements:</strong> To interact with specific components of WhatsApp, such as search fields and results.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use the Data</h2>
        <p>All data accessed via the AccessibilityService API is used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To check whether a phone number is registered on WhatsApp.</li>
            <li>To perform this functionality in real-time, locally on your device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The app does not store or retain any data after the check is complete.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p><strong>No data is shared or transmitted to external servers, third parties, or other applications.</strong> All operations are performed locally on your device, ensuring that your information remains private and secure.</p>

        <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
        <p>The app requires certain permissions to function, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accessibility Service: To perform the number-checking functionality within WhatsApp.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You must explicitly enable these permissions for the app to function. You can disable permissions at any time through your device settings.</p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>We are committed to ensuring that your data is secure. The app operates entirely on your device, and no data is transmitted to external servers or stored anywhere.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Consent</h2>
        <p>By using this app and enabling the required permissions, you consent to the use of the AccessibilityService API as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in legal requirements or app functionality. We encourage you to review this page periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.</p>
